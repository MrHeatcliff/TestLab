Research focuses on AI and its application. Build an automatic or semi-automatic system.

The first research field is **Humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI)** which designs AI to better interaction between humans and computers. 
There are many topics in the HCI field, such as Chatbot, facial emotion recognition (FER), and automatic speech recognition (ASR).

The second research field is **AI for Healthcare** where we can apply AI to improve the analysis, presentation, and comprehension of complex medical and healthcare data.
